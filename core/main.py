"""Demonstration script for the signal_lab project.

This script shows how to use the instrument classes defined in `devices.py`
using context managers to ensure clean resource management.  It sets a
frequency on a signal generator, enables its output, measures the frequency
with a spectrum analyzer, and then disables the output.  The printed output
illustrates the sequence of operations and the effect of simulated measurement
noise.
